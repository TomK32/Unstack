title: Sirtet
---

<p>Inspired by the classic game Tetris, Sirtet for MacOSX turns the stack around. Stop piling up blocks until you hit the ceiling and start picking them out until none are left. The ideal casual game for everyone who was terrible in Tetris and wants to take revenge on that blocks.</p>

<p>Guaranteed free of any soviet bands and dancers ruining your end score, and of course we won't endanger you by a pointless cosmos-rocket take-off. Enjoy a much less confusing game with the scientifically approved three colours red, green and blue.
