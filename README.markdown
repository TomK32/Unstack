Sirtet
======

Sirtet is a game inspired by the classic Tetris. If you are among those whose'
tetris lines got stacked up sky high it's your time to rewind the game.
You start with a field full with block and your goal to remove the
blocks from the field matching your next piece to remove. Confused? Great :)

History
-------

The game was created on April 1st in no more than eight hours, why you expect a history?

I had four cuppa tea, a Leberkassemmel, a bag of paprika chips, some
butter bread and salami, and two bottle of Club Mate Cola (fantastic stuff!)
during development. Oh and there was loads of heavy police in the house
opposite the lab. Wonder what happended there.
